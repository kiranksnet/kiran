# Project Name: Training for Image Classification Using Naiive Baye
# COMPSCIX433.3-010 - Kiran Khanderao - final Project
# -----------------------------------------------------------

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
# The purpose of this project is to train a dataset (of image) to do # classication using Naiive Bay Method (model). After successfully training # using test data set, it can efficiently classify handwritten characters.

### Faculty and Learning Support
#   Prof. Alexander Iliev of Berkeley Extension 


### Methods and Technology Used
# Inferential Statistics
# Machine Learning
# Data Visualization
# Predictive Modeling
# Python Language / Packages like Pandas
# Google Colab


## Project Description
In this project focus is on developing a model by using train.csv data to accurately do Image Classification based on Naiive Baye method. 
The results were accurate enough (>80%) to be able to do classication of handwritten "characters" (letters) 

## Getting Started

1. The following files have been uploaded into Github under URL.
https://github.com/kiranksnet/kiran

a) Kiran_Final_Project_Assign_numbayes_updated.ipynb
b) test.zip
c) train.zip* 
Note: While running Kiran_Final_Project_Assign_numbayes_updated.ipynb please ensure *train.csv is in the same folder; Otherwise it will error out).

2. Clone this repo (https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
